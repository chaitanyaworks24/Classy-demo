  {
    question: "How much will my home interior actually cost?",
    answer: "Costs depend entirely on the scope, materials, and specific requirements of your project. We provide a detailed, transparent, itemized estimate after our initial consultation, ensuring you understand exactly what you are paying for before any commitment."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will the entire interior project take?",
    answer: "A standard apartment interior typically takes between 45 to 90 days from finalizing the design to handover. Larger villas or complex custom builds require more time. We provide a clear project schedule and stick to it."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know the quoted price won’t increase unexpectedly?",
    answer: "Our pricing is transparent and fixed for the approved scope of work. Price changes only occur if you explicitly request a design change or material upgrade during the execution phase."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if there is a problem with the design, materials, or execution?",
    answer: "We take full accountability for our work. All our modular woodwork and hardware come with comprehensive warranties, and our dedicated project managers ensure strict quality control throughout the build phase."
  },
  {
    question: "How involved do I need to be during the project?",
    answer: "Once the design is approved, our team handles all procurement, site management, and execution. You will receive regular progress updates, meaning you can be as hands-off as you prefer while retaining complete peace of mind."
